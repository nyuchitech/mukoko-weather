## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyuchitech/mukoko-weather.git
cd mukoko-weather
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB Atlas connection string for caching and data storage |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Anthropic API key for AI weather summaries. Without it, a basic fallback summary is generated |
| `DB_INIT_SECRET` | No | Protects the `/api/db-init` endpoint in production (via `x-init-secret` header) |

### Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build      # Production build
npm start          # Start production server
npm test           # Run Vitest tests (single run)
npm run test:watch # Run Vitest in watch mode
npm run lint       # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit   # Type check
```

The app redirects `/` to `/harare` by default.

## Architecture

### Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Redirects to `/harare` |
| `/[location]` | Weather overview — current conditions, AI summary, activity insights, atmospheric metric cards |
| `/[location]/atmosphere` | 24-hour atmospheric detail charts (humidity, wind, pressure, UV) |
| `/[location]/forecast` | Hourly (24h) + daily (7-day) forecast charts + sunrise/sunset |
| `/[location]/map` | Full-viewport interactive weather map with layer switcher |
| `/explore` | AI chatbot (Shamwari Explorer) + category/country browse |
| `/explore/[tag]` | Browse locations filtered by tag |
| `/explore/country` | Browse locations by country index |
| `/explore/country/[code]` | Browse locations in a specific country |
| `/explore/country/[code]/[province]` | Browse locations in a specific province |
| `/status` | System health dashboard (live checks for all services) |
| `/about` | Company information |
| `/help` | User help / FAQ |
| `/history` | Historical weather data dashboard (search, multi-day charts, data table) |
| `/privacy` | Privacy policy |
| `/terms` | Terms of service |
| `/embed` | Embeddable widget documentation |

The main location page is a compact overview. Detail-heavy sections (charts, atmospheric trends, hourly/daily forecasts) live on dedicated sub-route pages. This reduces initial page load weight and prevents mobile OOM crashes.

### API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/weather?lat=&lon=` | GET | Weather data (Tomorrow.io → Open-Meteo fallback, MongoDB cached 15-min TTL). `X-Weather-Provider` header indicates source |
| `/api/ai` | POST | AI weather summary. Body: `{ weatherData, location }`. Tiered TTL cache (30/60/120 min) |
| `/api/explore` | POST | Shamwari Explorer chatbot. Body: `{ message, history }`. Rate-limited 20 req/hour/IP |
| `/api/search?q=&tag=&lat=&lon=` | GET | Location search (text, tag filter, geospatial nearest) |
| `/api/geo?lat=&lon=` | GET | Nearest location lookup (supports `autoCreate=true` for community locations) |
| `/api/locations` | GET | List/filter locations (by slug, tag, all, or stats mode) |
| `/api/locations/add` | POST | Add locations via search (`{ query }`) or coordinates (`{ lat, lon }`). Rate-limited |
| `/api/activities` | GET | Activities (by id, category, search, labels, or categories mode) |
| `/api/suitability` | GET | Suitability rules (all or by key) |
| `/api/tags` | GET | Tag metadata (all or featured) |
| `/api/regions` | GET | Active supported regions (bounding boxes) |
| `/api/status` | GET | System health checks (MongoDB, APIs, cache) |
| `/api/history?location=&days=` | GET | Historical weather data for a location |
| `/api/map-tiles?z=&x=&y=&layer=` | GET | Tile proxy for Tomorrow.io map layers (keeps API key server-side) |
| `/api/db-init` | POST | One-time DB setup + seed data. Protected by `DB_INIT_SECRET` in production |

### Resilience

The app follows a Netflix-style resilience philosophy — the shell never crashes, failures are isolated per-section.

**4-stage weather fallback chain:**
1. MongoDB cache (15-min TTL)
2. Tomorrow.io API (primary provider)
3. Open-Meteo API (free fallback)
4. `createFallbackWeather` seasonal estimates (always succeeds)

**3-layer error isolation:**
1. **Server-side safety net** — `page.tsx` wraps data fetching in try/catch; even if all providers fail, the page renders with seasonal estimates
2. **Per-section error boundaries** — every weather section is wrapped in `ChartErrorBoundary`; a chart crash only affects that section
3. **Page-level error boundaries** — last resort `error.tsx` pages with retry tracking (max 3 retries via sessionStorage)

**Observability:**
- Server-side: structured JSON logging (`logError`/`logWarn` in `src/lib/observability.ts`) for Vercel Log Drains
- Client-side: GA4 exception events via `reportErrorToAnalytics` in error boundaries and error pages
- Provider failure tracking: `reportProviderFailure` for weather API monitoring

### Lazy Loading

Both the location page and history page use feed-style progressive loading via `LazySection` (IntersectionObserver wrapper). Only the first section loads eagerly; everything below the fold is deferred until scrolled near.
