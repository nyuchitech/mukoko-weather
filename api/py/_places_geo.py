"""Helpers for writing to ``places.placesGeo`` and integrating with Fundi.

Phase 0E (search-miss flow):

When a user adds a new location via ``/api/py/locations/add`` we
   1. keep the legacy write to ``weather.locations`` (back-compat)
   2. mirror the entry into the platform's ``places.placesGeo`` so the
      Nyuchi platform has a canonical admin/geographic record for it
   3. enqueue a Fundi Places seed request so the Fundi worker can later
      populate ``places.places`` with POIs (schools, businesses, etc.)
      in the surrounding radius.

Fundi runs as a separate service (MCP, not callable from Python), so the
integration is **queue based** — mukoko writes a request document to
``places.seedRequests`` and Fundi polls/consumes it. Mukoko fires and
forgets; there is no polling endpoint on this side.

    Behaviour:
      1. **Always dedup first, ref before geometry.** When ``osm_ref`` is
         given, :func:`find_placesgeo_by_osm_ref` is tried first — an exact
         match on the map's own feature id, which is stable across GPS
         jitter and distinct between neighbouring features. Only on a ref
         miss does it fall back to :func:`find_nearby_placesgeo`
         (``dedup_radius_km`` radius, default 5 km — pass the caller's own
         duplicate-gate radius so the two checks can't disagree; normalised
         name; country-scoped ``parentPlaceId``), which is what still joins
         records created before refs were captured. That fallback carries a
         **ref veto**: a nearby same-named candidate already stamped with a
         DIFFERENT ref is a different feature and is never merged onto.

         A ref-less record matched by the geometry fallback is
         **backfilled** with the ref, so the next visit to that place joins
         by identity rather than by luck. No batch migration is needed —
         existing records adopt refs as they are visited.

         The dedup read + insert run under a short cross-instance creation
         lock (keyed by the ref when there is one, else country + normalised
         name), so two near-simultaneous requests for the same brand-new
         place can't both slip past the dedup read and double-insert
         (TOCTOU).
      2. If a match is found, the existing document is returned with an
         added ``wasExisting: True`` marker. NO insert is performed and NO
         suffixed/alternate slug is generated — that would create the kind
         of duplicate-record corruption Phase 0E is meant to prevent.

         When ``mukoko_slug`` is provided and the existing doc lacks one,
         the existing doc is **patched** in place to stamp the slug. This
         lets pre-existing platform-seeded entries become discoverable by
         the mukoko clean-slug resolver without creating a duplicate.
      3. Otherwise, a new doc is built and inserted. The platform validator
         does NOT include a ``bundu`` field on placesGeo, so the document
         is constructed manually instead of via ``stamp_platform_fields``.

    Phase 0F: ``mukoko_slug``, ``mukoko_tags``, and
    ``mukoko_nominatim_address`` are now stored under ``sourceProvenance``
    so the TypeScript ``resolveLocationSlug`` helper can find user-added
    placesGeo entries by their clean mukoko URL slug without a name lookup.
