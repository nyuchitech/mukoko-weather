"""Overpass-backed naming for bare coordinates.

Why this exists
---------------
Naming a coordinate used to go through Nominatim's ``/reverse``, which returns a
postal-address view of a point. ``_extract_location_name`` then tried to
reconstruct "what is actually here" out of address fields — a POI name if the
address happened to carry one, else a suburb, else a road, else a city. It is an
approximation of a question Nominatim was not built to answer.

Overpass answers it directly. It queries OSM itself, so we can ask for named
features within a radius *and* the administrative areas containing the point in
a single round trip:

* ``nwr(around:R,lat,lon)[name]`` — every named node/way/relation nearby, with
  its raw OSM tags, so we can rank a school above the street it sits on.
* ``is_in(lat,lon)`` — the areas enclosing the point, which is where country
  (``ISO3166-1``) and province (``admin_level=4``) come from. This is the
  "GeoJSON admin boundary" lookup, except OSM already holds the polygons and
  does the point-in-polygon server-side, so there is no boundary dataset to
  ship, version or keep current.

Where it runs
-------------
Creation only — never the render path. Overpass is a shared community resource:
queries take seconds and are rate-limited by the instance, so putting it in
front of a page render would trade a 404 for a timeout. Smart slugs already make
the render path self-sufficient (see ``src/lib/smart-slug.ts``); this module
produces the good name that gets *stored*, so the next visitor's enrichment
lookup finds it locally.

Nominatim remains the fallback. Overpass returning nothing is normal for genuinely
empty coordinates (open ocean, deep rural), and an instance being busy is routine,
so callers degrade rather than fail.
